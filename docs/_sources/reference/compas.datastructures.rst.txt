.. module:: compas.datastructures

:mod:`compas.datastructures` defines a mesh datastructure, a network, and a cellular mesh.


Mesh
====

:class:`compas.datastructures.Mesh` is implemented as a half-edge datastructure.
It is meant for the representation of polygonal *"surface"* meshes. A mesh can be
connected or disconnected. A mesh can be closed or open. A mesh can be comprised
of only vertices.

.. unified face orientation => consistent/compatible cycle directions
.. vertex => neighbours => halfedges => faces (optionally ordered around vertex)
.. face => vertices => halfedges => neighbours
.. vertex => connectivity, area, normal, laplacian, ...
.. face => area, normal, ...

    Mesh


Network
=======

:class:`compas.datastructures.Network` is a connectivity graph.
It is meant for the representation of networks of vertices connected by edges.
The edges are directed. A network does not have faces. A network can be connected
or disconnected. A network with vertices only is also a valid network.

.. vertex => neighbours, laplacian
.. edge =>

.. form := network => ordering of neighbours is enough to construct dual
.. force := mesh => with faces constructed from the ordering ov neighbours

VolMesh
=======

:class:`compas.datastructures.VolMesh` is a cellular mesh. It is implemented as
a half-plane, the three-dimensional equivalent of a half-edge. It can, for example,
be used for the representation of subdivided/partitioned polyhedra.
