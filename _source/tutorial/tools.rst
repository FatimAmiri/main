Making tools
********************************************************************************

In this tutorial, we will make a form finding tool for Rhino
providing basic user interaction, management of settings, data persistence, and
different options for solving the equilibrium problem.

The goal is to link framework functionality to a Rhino toolbar through a controller
and to simplify the process of generating the required Rhino user interface file
or ``rui``.
